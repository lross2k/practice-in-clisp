# Practice in Common Lisp
I have never used Lisp, so here I'll be throwing all the coding tests and examples done for learning
purposes

I'm using SBCL in Debian Linux, no idea of how to run this on other platforms or interpreters
```txt
$ sbcl --script filename.lisp
```

# Done
## Basic language usage
- Hello World
- Basic functions
- Variables
- Lists
- List managing functions
- Macros
- While loop
- Classes
- Generic functions and methods
